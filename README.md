# CDRXL

An experimental reimplementation of continuous-time deconvolutional regressive neural networks (CDRNNs; [https://github.com/coryshain/cdr](https://github.com/coryshain/cdr)) optimized for large-scale datasets with many predictors and/or responses.
Feature-limited, no support for model visualization or statistical inference.
The primary target application is accurate prediction at scale for continuous-time domains.
